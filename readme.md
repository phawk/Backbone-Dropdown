# Backbone.Dropdown

A simple dropdown component for backbone, draws a list of options from a collection and triggers an event when one is selected. This is an alternative to [Chosen](http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/) with minimal styling so you can make it look however you want.

The API is built for Backbone developers and means you donâ€™t need to shoehorn your data into a `<select>` field.

## Usage

```js
var dropdown = new Backbone.Dropdown({
    // A Backbone collection of models
    collection: my_collection,

    // The field in the model you want to use as the title, defaults to 'title'
    title_field: 'name'
});

$('.my-container').append(dropdown.render().$el);

dropdown.on('select', function(model) {
    // The model that was selected
});
```

## Boilerplate CSS

Use the css in *dropdown.css* as a starting point to customise this menu to your hearts content.
